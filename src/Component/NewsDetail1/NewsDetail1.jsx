                Transforming rural education, increasing literacy and
                opportunities for girls
              </p>
              <p className="News-detail">
                Education is a fundamental right and women in rural areas are
                deprived of this right. According to the Planning Commission
                Report on Literacy Pakistan, the literacy rate in urban areas is
                80℅ and 20 ℅ in rural areas. The literacy rate of women is 59℅
                in Pakistan as compared to men which is 70℅. Since independence,
                we have discussed this problem with limited efforts and few
                results. Transformation of the rural education system is
                essential for a brighter future for rural women, their families,
                the next generation and community well-being. The
                revolutionization of the education system in terms of
                technology-based education, and skilled-based courses, to build
                leadership qualities in rural women to lead their community and
                shape their children’s future is the need of the hour. Before
                the transformation of any system, first, we need to understand
                the basics of what needs to be transformed.

                  Poverty in rural areas is the backbone of every problem.

                  In rural areas, due to poverty people prioritize their son to
                  send to school and burden their daughters with household
                  chores. People don’t have enough resources to support their
                  girls. According to a World Bank report, most of the girls are
                  enrolled at the beginning and almost 49℅ drop out of the
                  school in the next 2 years.

                  <span className="heading3-p-span">Security concerns: </span>
                  The security of girls is a big concern. Schools are fewer in
                  number and mostly away from home and it becomes difficult for
                  rural people to maintain their safety when harassment and rape
                  cases are increasing day by day. Despite these problems, there
                  is always hope for the better. By understanding the hidden
                  causes, we can develop a road map for the transformation of
                  education, and increase literacy and opportunities for girls
                  in rural areas. Which steps should be taken to address the
                  challenges and build a strong and educated community are

                  It requires the collaborative effort of national and
                  international organizations, and government sectors to
                  prioritize this matter and provide free access to the
                  internet, online courses, virtual learning opportunities and
                  the establishment of computer labs. The introduction of
                  digital tools is also essential. The free laptop scheme was a
                  good initiative by the Punjab government for educational
                  transformation.
